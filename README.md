# Greedy Snake 2.0

### Greedy Snake 2.0 is a remake of the classic mobile game, Greedy Snake, inspired by the psychological phenomenon called cognitive dissonance. On top of the original game mechanics, this game is introduces a second player whose task is a to prevent the growth of the snake by pressing a relevant key when the snake eats a food item. The game makes use of cognitive dissonance, the discomfort that results from holding two conflicting ideas, to increase the difficulty level and potentially train the dialectical thinking of the player.
